# TheBoysBowling

A website used to showcase the statistics of a sub-par group of "bowlers" www.theboysbowling.co.uk

## Client

This repo is specifically for the front-end or client side of the project. Made up of a simple single-page React app, it uses the Axios package to request specific API endpoints to our server. I kept the client side relatively simple with very little client-side computation for the statistics shown as I thought this would increase load times and relieve computational pressure on any lower-end devices trying to view.
